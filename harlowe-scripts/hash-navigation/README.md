## Hash navigation for Harlowe

This script enables hash navigation inside Harlowe stories.

This is a port of the [Sugarcube version](https://github.com/MalifaciousGames/Mali-s-Scripts/tree/main/sugarcube-scripts/hash-navigation), please check the documentation there.

Both versions do basically the same thing with one *caveat* : 

In Harlowe, the story's starting passage **always** runs, even if it is removed from the history soon after.
