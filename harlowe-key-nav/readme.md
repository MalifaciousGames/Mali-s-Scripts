## Key navigation for Harlowe

This script automatically binds keyboard keys to the links in a passage, first using number keys, then letters if more than 9 links are present.

Back and forth navigation are bound to the left and right arrow keys.

This script can be enabled or disabled by setting the `KeyNav.enabled` JS variable.
